Posted by XhmikosR on 01/10/2012

After almost 6 weeks after the previous stable release, we decided to release 1.6.4.

It's a maintenance release with a couple of UI improvements, few bugfixes and better API.

Highlights of this release:

* Better UTF8 support for webui
* Chapter indicators on seekbar
* Improved DVD and PSG (BD) sub handling
* Changed default maximum subtitle resolution to "Desktop"
