We are always in need of people willing to help us make MPC-HC better.

We are mostly looking for:

* C++ developers
* designers to create logos for the player or images for the file associations
* web developers to maintain the main website

If you want to help, please join our [IRC channel](/contact-us/) and talk to us.
Any help is always appreciated so don't hesitate.
