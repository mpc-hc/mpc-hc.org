title: v1.7.7 is released
---

After 3 months since our last stable build, we are happy to announce v1.7.7.

This release is a bugfix release, with many improvements and a few new features.

Highlights of this release:

* Fixed a crash affecting DVD playback with subtitles on 64-bit builds
* Worked around a bug in the latest NVIDIA driver (v344.11) which caused a corrupted display of 10-bit videos
* Improved HEVC decoding: software decoding should be up to twice faster and hardware accelerated decoding is now available (but still experimental so disabled by default)
* Improved subtitle renderer and subtitle queue (more than twice faster on complex subtitle scripts)
* Support for audio cover art
* New Arabic and Thai translations. Remember that you can [help us](https://trac.mpc-hc.org/wiki/Translations)
  translating MPC-HC to your language.

Don't forget, that our official builds, both the stable and the beta builds,
[are digitally signed](/2013/02/25/binaries-are-signed/).
Be aware of scams and only get the files from our site!
