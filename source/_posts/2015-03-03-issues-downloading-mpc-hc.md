title: Issues downloading MPC-HC
---

It has come to our attention that some people are having trouble downloading MPC-HC.

See the related Google [blog post](https://search.googleblog.com/2015/02/more-protection-from-unwanted-software.html).

As a result of those changes to the malware protection in Google Chrome,
SourceForge, which is hosting our MPC-HC downloads, can't be used to get the latest version of our software.
We advise users to use a different browser like [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)
or disable the malware protection in Chrome in order to download MPC-HC.
