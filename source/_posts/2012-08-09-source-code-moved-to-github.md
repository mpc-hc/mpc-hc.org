title: Source code moved to GitHub
---

After a lot of discussion, all the people involved with the development decided
to move to [Git](http://git-scm.com/) and to [GitHub](https://github.com/mpc-hc/mpc-hc)
for hosting the source.

The SourceForge SVN repository isn't updated anymore, but this might change
in the future and we might sync it.

Things are easier now for people who want to contribute.
Fork the repository, do your changes and then create
a [pull request](https://github.com/mpc-hc/mpc-hc/pulls).
