title: v1.6.6 is released
---

After 3 months since the last stable build, we decided to release 1.6.6.
This release has many bugfixes and a few new features.
Also, the binaries [are digitally signed](/2013/02/25/binaries-are-signed/)
so you can easily verify their integrity.

Highlights of this release:

* Uncompressed RAR files can now be played directly in MPC-HC, drag any .rar or part file (.r00, .r01, etc.) into the player to play it (thanks to RARFileSource)
* The Subtitle menu now shows all available subtitle tracks including the tracks offered by the splitter
* "Now playing" information can now be sent to Skype's mood message, MSN support has been removed
* VSync is now turned off by default due to playback issues, if you have Aero on you already have VSync and will not notice the difference
* The hotkeys related to D3D Fullscreen and Frame Time Correction have changed to avoid accidental activation
* The external filter list has been split for the 32-bit and 64-bit versions of the player, your current filter list will automatically be corrected

Also besides the usual localization updates a new **Romanian** localization has been added.
We'd like to thank our translators for keeping MPC-HC accessible to our non-English users.

You can download the new version [here](/downloads/).
For the complete changes see the [changelog](/changelog/).
