title: What are the differences between Guliverkli2 and MPC-HC?
---

Gabest, the original author of Media Player Classic, stopped working on it by the end of 2006.
Since then, two forks have been created.

The main differences are that Guliverkli2 contains a few patches made by various people,
and MPC-HC contains new features. Most patches present in Guliverkli2 are also present in MPC-HC.
