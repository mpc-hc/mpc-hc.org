After 5 months since our last stable build, we are happy to announce v1.7.10.

This release is a bugfix release, with many improvements and a few new features.

A few highlights of this release:

* Completely new Internal Audio Renderer:
    * Uses sanear project as backend
    * Requires Windows Vista or newer
    * Outputs sound through WASAPI (shared or exclusive)
    * Employs automatic channel downmixing
    * Provides stereo crossfeed processing option (for headphones)
    * Tries to preserve signal pitch when playing at custom rate (time stretching)
    * Supports bitstreaming

    Note that you need to select the new renderer in options in order to use it
* Windows 10 related fixes:
	* Improved mouse behavior
	* Fixed volume control with scroll wheel
	* Window snapping to desktop edges
* Allow hardware decoding of UHD video with AMD cards
* Big video rendering stability improvement
* New Indonesian, Lithuanian and Punjabi translations. Remember that you can
  [help us](https://trac.mpc-hc.org/wiki/Translations) translating MPC-HC to your language.

Don't forget, that our official builds, both the stable and the beta builds,
[are digitally signed](/2013/02/25/binaries-are-signed/).
Be aware of scams and only get the files from our site!

Also, to report bugs, suggestions and generally provide feedback, use our [Trac](https://trac.mpc-hc.org/);
reporting anything on social media or in any other place is just pointless, as the developers only follow Trac.
