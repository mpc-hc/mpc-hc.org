title: Binaries moved to MaxCDN
---

In the light of recent events, we decided to move away from SourceForge completely.

SourceForge has served us well for many years, from the very first days back in 2006.
But many things have changed since then, and we needed to adapt to that.

First, [we moved our source code to GitHub](/2012/08/09/source-code-moved-to-github/).
Then we managed to [move to our own server and domain](/2013/02/24/website-was-moved/),
the server was kindly provided by [CloudVPS](https://www.cloudvps.com/).

Now the time has come to move the last thing away from SourceForge, which is our binaries.
We are happy to be provided with a CDN by [MaxCDN](https://www.maxcdn.com/).
Right now everything on this site is powered by MaxCDN infrastructure, including the binaries.

What does this mean for our end users, you? Speed should be a lot better for people
around the world. Should any issues arise, feel free to [contact us](/contact-us/).
