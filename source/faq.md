1. **What are the requirements for MPC-HC?**

    In order to run MPC-HC you must have an SSE capable CPU. MPC-HC will work on
    Windows® XP Service Pack 3, Vista, 7 and 8, both 32-bit (x86) and 64-bit (x64).

2. **My picture is up-side down, how do I fix it?**

    Try updating your video card drivers.

3. **Why is there suddenly a different seekbar in fullscreen?**

    You have accidentally enabled D3D Fullscreen, go to Options -> Output
    and disable the D3D Fullscreen checkbox.

4. **Why am I seeing tearing in the video?**

    The video display is experiencing a synchronisation issue, try enabling V-Sync by pressing V.
    If you have more than one monitor connected make sure you extend the screen instead of duplicating it.

5. **Why am I seeing strange glitches in the video?**

    Hardware acceleration is most likely not working correctly.
    Try going to Options -> Internal Filters, right-click the list on the right
    and click "Disable DXVA filters" and then reload the video file.
    If this does not solve and your video file plays correctly in other
    video players then please make a bug report.

6. **Will MPC-HC support Windows RT or Metro?**

    Supporting these new platforms require many changes and this is simply
    not possible for us in the near future, with the current manpower.
