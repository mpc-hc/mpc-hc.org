.. abstract

After almost 1 and a half months since our last stable build, we decided to release v1.7.1.

This release is mostly a bugfix release, with a few new features.

.. body


Highlights of this release:

- Fixed MPC-HC crashing on startup on >= Windows 8. Broken codecs installed on the
  system tend to crash the player on startup. Now this crash will only happen if/when
  you enter capture mode. One common cause is **ffdshow x64**. Check if you have it installed and uninstall it.

- Many LAV Filters fixes including a crash on AMD cards with DXVA when stopping playback

- Fixed subtitle selection settings of the internal LAV splitter
