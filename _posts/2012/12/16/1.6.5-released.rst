Highlights of this release:

Some long standing issues for the Internal Subtitle Renderer/VSFilter have been fixed:

* Support UTF-8 subtitles without BOM
* Fix high memory usage with complex subtitles (mostly ASS)
* Fix most cases where subtitles are not correctly positioned
* Allow floating-point values for \\fscx and \\fscy in ASS subtitles

Windows 8 is now officially supported and the file association problem has
been solved. Windows 8 users should click the "Set Default Programs" button
after selecting new formats.
