We are in dire need of new developers of any kind.
If you can code a little, or you can create logos for the player and images for the file associations, or you can create/maintain the main website, please join our `IRC channel <webchat.freenode.net/?channels=mpc-hc,#mpc-hc-dev>`_ and talk to us. Any help is always appreciated.
